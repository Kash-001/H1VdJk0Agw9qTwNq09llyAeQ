### Deeper Analysis and Actual Exploits:

Now that I've fully examined the script, let me break down the real exploit opportunities. I'll be going over each section of the script with a focus on exploitable issues and how an attacker could **actually** gain admin permissions or abuse functionality.

---

### 1. **Vulnerability in `requestCommand.OnServerEvent` RemoteEvent**

```lua
game.ReplicatedStorage.adminReplicated.requestCommand.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, command, ...)
    local args = ...

    if isAdminCommand(player, command) then
        commands[command](player, ...)
    end
end)
```

- **Issue**: This code listens for RemoteEvent `requestCommand` from any client. While it checks if the player can run the command (`isAdminCommand(player, command)`), the **main exploit** is the exposure of the event to clients.
  
- **Actual Exploit**: Any player can attempt to fire this remote event and guess command names. Even if they aren't an admin, they can try to fire events like "kick" or "to". If there is any failure in validating their rank within `isAdminCommand`, they can abuse this to run admin commands without permission.
  
  - **Example Exploit Script**: A hacker can simply run this from the client:

    ```lua
    local replicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    replicatedStorage.adminReplicated.requestCommand:FireServer("kick", "victimPlayerName")
    ```

    If this bypasses rank checks due to weaknesses in rank validation, the attacker can kick players at will.

---

### 2. **Weakness in `isAdminCommand` and `checkStaffRank` Validation**

```lua
local function isAdminCommand(player, command)
    return commands[command] and checkStaffRank(player)
end
```

- **Issue**: `checkStaffRank(player)` is used to check if the player has permission to run a command. However, there is **no information in this script** about how exactly `checkStaffRank` is implemented. If there are any bugs or vulnerabilities in the logic of this function, it can be **exploited** by a user to bypass rank checks.

- **Real Exploit Possibility**:
  - If `checkStaffRank` simply relies on the player being in a certain group or having a certain rank, an attacker could spoof their group rank. For instance, if the game uses an external API (like `Player:GetRankInGroup`) but doesn’t verify the response properly, the attacker can exploit this by intercepting and altering HTTP traffic or using cheat engines that manipulate client-server communication.

---

### 3. **Direct Exploit of Command Table `commands`**

```lua
local commands = {
    ['kick'] = function(player, ...)
        local args = ...
        local target = GetPlayer(args[2])
        
        if target then
            if hasRank(player, 249) then
                target:Kick(args[3])
                game.ReplicatedStorage.adminReplicated.displayNotification:FireClient(player, target.Name.." a été kick")
            else
                game.ReplicatedStorage.adminReplicated.displayNotification:FireClient(player, "Permissions insuffisantes")
            end
        end
    end,
}
```

- **Issue**: If the `commands` table is exposed or accessible from the client, it could be directly exploited to run any of these commands without the rank checks.

- **Real Exploit**: Since the commands themselves (such as `kick`, `to`, `view`) are stored in a Lua table, an attacker who gains access to this table (possibly through another vulnerability) can run any command by calling it directly. This could allow them to kick players, teleport, or use any admin functionality, as long as they can invoke the function.

### 4. **Ban System Exploit**

```lua
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(p)
    if bans:GetAsync(p.UserId, true) then
        p:Kick("Vous êtes banni")
    end
end)
```

- **Issue**: The ban system uses a Roblox `DataStore` to store ban records. While this is generally secure, there are a couple of possible attack vectors:
  - If the `DataStoreService` API calls are not secured by server-side code, a player could potentially attempt to overwrite the ban list or spoof responses by manipulating HTTP traffic.
  
  - An attacker with access to a compromised admin account could also remove bans by simply clearing entries in this DataStore.

- **Real Exploit**:
  - Players could use tools like Synapse X or other Lua injection tools to manipulate the DataStore if they discover ways to interact with it from the client, especially if any unintended exposure happens through remotes.
  
  - An admin-level exploit could be carried out by a malicious insider with admin privileges to unban users.

---

### 5. **Teleport Exploit via `TeleportService`**

```lua
['join'] = function(player, ...)
    local args = ...
    local placeId = game.PlaceId
    local jobid = args[2]

    if jobid then
        game:GetService("TeleportService"):TeleportToPlaceInstance(placeId, jobid, player)
    end
end,
```

- **Issue**: This command allows players to join other servers by providing a `jobid`. There doesn't appear to be any validation on the target server or job ID.
  
- **Real Exploit**: 
  - An attacker could use this to teleport to any server instance, possibly interfering with private sessions or admin-only areas. They could generate random `jobid`s and teleport themselves into places they normally wouldn’t have access to.
  
  - **Exploit Script**:
    ```lua
    local replicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    replicatedStorage.adminReplicated.requestCommand:FireServer("join", "targetJobID")
    ```

    This could be abused to invade private instances of the game.

### 6. **Webhook Manipulation**

```lua
local webhook = ws:new()
webhook.Author = player.Name
webhook.Description = args[1] .. " " .. args[2]
webhook:sendAuthorEmbed(webhookUrl)
```

- **Issue**: The webhook system logs admin actions to an external service. If the `webhookUrl` or the webhook service itself is compromised, it could allow an attacker to manipulate or fake logs.

- **Real Exploit**:
  - Attackers could tamper with the webhook's URL or exploit the external webhook service to inject false logs, cover their actions, or even send malicious requests that could manipulate data on the webhook receiver's side.

---

### 7. **Icon Visibility Toggle (`staffover` Command)**

```lua
['staffover'] = function(player, ...)
    local args = ...
    local target = GetPlayer(args[2])

    if target then
        for i,v in pairs(targetHum:GetDescendants()) do
            if v.Name == "Icon" and v:IsA('ImageLabel') then
                v.Visible = false  -- hides the staff tag
            end
        end
    end
end,
```

- **Issue**: This command allows admins to toggle staff visibility. If improperly protected, attackers could abuse this to manipulate staff visibility to impersonate staff members or obscure the fact that they are staff.

- **Real Exploit**: An attacker with the ability to fire this command could hide their staff tag, perform malicious actions, and then re-enable it, effectively avoiding detection by other players.

### Conclusion and Needed Resources:

**Main Real Exploits**:
1. **Remote Event Exploitation**: The most immediate vulnerability is the exposure of `requestCommand.OnServerEvent`. If not properly secured, this allows attackers to fire any admin command remotely.
   
2. **Rank Spoofing**: Depending on how `checkStaffRank` is implemented, there may be rank spoofing opportunities.

3. **Teleport and Kick Abuse**: These commands could be exploited for harassment or to invade private instances of the game.

### To Perform Deeper Validation:
- **External Resources**: I would need access to the following to continue the deep inspection:
  1. **`checkStaffRank` function**: This function is critical to the security of the admin commands, and without it, I can't fully assess the security of rank validation.
  2. **Any modules used for `ws` (WebhookSender)**: I need to verify if the webhook sending process is secured and what external vulnerabilities it might introduce.
  
Let me know if you have these or if you would like further assistance with mitigation.
